Rather than going in and editing the name everywhere it appears, simply set a variable called '$firstAider' in your content and set 'firstAider = John Doe' in the plugin params. When the First Aider changes, simply change the plugin parameter to 'Jane Doe' and all the names will change throughout the site.</p>"
